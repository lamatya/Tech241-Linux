## What is virtualisation?

Virtualisation in cloud computing refers to the technology that creates virtual instances of resources such as servers, storgae and networks. It enables cloud providers to serve users with their existing physical computer hardware and enables cloud users to purchase only the computing resources they need when they need it and to scale those resources cost-effectively as their workloads grow.

They offer flexibility, scalability, and efficiency while reducing costs and providing a safe and isolated environment for running multiple operating systems and applications simultaneously.

## What is a virtual machine?

It is a computer system that is created using software on one physical computer in order to emulate the functionality of another separate physical computer.


## Where can they be run?

Virtual machine run on a physical machine and access computing resources from software called a hypervior. 


## What determines how many can run?

- Hardware resources

- VM resource requirements.

- Workload Demand


What does a virtual machine include?

- Virtualised Hardware

- Applications and Software

- Operating System

- Configuration Settings

- Management Interfaces

## What software is required to orchestrate/run the virtual machines?

Virtualisation Software and hypervisors.


## What is the importance of an image when creating an VM?

Image is important in VM creation because it ensures consistency, saves time, enables scalability, facilitates version control, aids in disaster recovery, and supports collaboration and sharing. It is a fundamental component in the lifecycle of virtual machines.
